## 2
- [ ] **Advanced Class Design**

- [ ] Identify when and how to apply abstract classes

- [ ] Construct abstract Java classes and subclasses

- [ ] Use the static and final keywords

- [ ] Create top-level and nested subclasses

- [ ] Use enumerated types

## 3
- [ ] **Object-oriented  Design Principles**

- [ ] Write code that declares, implements, and/or extends interfaces

- [ ] Choose between interface inheritance and class inheritance

- [ ] Apply cohesion, low-coupling, IS-A, and HAS-A Principles

- [ ] Apply object composition Principles (including HAS-A relationships)

- [ ] Design a class using the **the Singleton design pattern**

- [ ] Design and create objects using the **Factory Pattern**
