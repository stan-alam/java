## notes on creating a Pascal compiler in Java


**I used to program countless hours in Borland's Pascal 6 for MS-DOS, 6.2 in my middle
school years, 1994-96. I wrote a pseudo-GUI to emulate Windows 3.11 which consisted of
more than 5,000 lines of code.**

This project will facilitate a way for me to further develop my "expertise" in
Java(and software engineering)
by building a Pascal compiler using core Java and various APIs.

Long-awaited revision to a unique guide that covers both compilers and interpreters
Revised, updated, and now focusing on Java instead of C++, this long-awaited, latest
edition of this popular book teaches programmers and software engineering students
how to write compilers and interpreters using Java. You?ll write compilers and
interpreters as case studies, generating general assembly code for a
Java Virtual Machine that takes advantage of the Java Collections Framework
to shorten and simplify the code. In addition, coverage includes Java Collections
Framework, UML modeling, object-oriented programming with design patterns,
working with XML intermediate code, and more.
